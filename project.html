<hr>

    <p> Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals either up or down the socioeconomic ladder in relation to the position of their parents. This is often described as absolute social mobility. Relative social 
mobility reflects the impact of socio-economic background on an individual’s outcomes in life. Global Social Mobility Index focuses on drivers of relative social mobility, such as specific policies, practices and institutions. 
This allows for effective comparisons between regions and generations. Global Social Mobility Index is determined based on the following indicators: health, education, technology access, work opportunities, working conditions 
and fair wages and finally social protection and inclusive institutions. This project seeks to understand the relationship between business climate and social mobility. This is done by evaluating different entrepreneurship indicators 
around the world and plotting Global Social Mobility Index and related metrics, such as poverty, against various entrepreneurship indicators. </p>
    
<!-- Chart 17 -- Social Mobility Index around the world -->
 <div class="chart" id="chart17">
      <script>
        var myChart17 = "ProjectSocMobIndex.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart17', myChart17);
      </script>
 </div>
 <p> Find the relevant Colab notebook for Figure 1 <a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/project/socMob_Pov.ipynb">here</a>. 
Social Mobility Index (SMI) is scraped from the Business Insider website (see the Colab notebook <a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/social_mob_ind_scraping.ipynb">here</a>), 
and poverty data is scraped from Wikipedia (see the Colab notebook <a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/project/poverty1.ipynb">here</a>).</p>   

 <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p> As evident from Figure 1, on average, SMI is higher in Europe, reaching over 80 in countries like Denmark and Sweden. African and Caribbean states have the lowest SMI in the sample with the index score as low as 36. 
      SMI varies the most in Asia, with countries like Bangladesh having the index score as low as 40, and states like Israel and Japan scoring around 70. </p>   
    
    <!-- Chart 22 -- Cost to open a business over time (as % of income per capita) -->
 <div class="chart" id="chart22">
      <script>
        var myChart22 = "CostOverTime.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart22', myChart22);
      </script>
 </div>   
   
    <p> Figure 2 shows cost of opening a business for countries with highest (Canada, UK, Denmark) and lowest (Guatemala, Senegal, Cameroon) SMI from the Figure 1 sample. 
The data is downloaded using the World Bank library in Python. The relevant Colab notebook is availible <a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/CostOverTime.ipynb">here</a>. 
Evidently, cost of opening business in states with lowest SMI has been declining significantly over the last two decades, which is a positive development since lower cost of opening a 
business is associated with lower poverty level (see below) and favoraly affects business activity. Meanwhile, for countries with highest SMI, the cost slightly fluctuated but stayed below 4% of income per capita. 
Clearly, there is a negative correlation between SMI and cost of opening a business. </p>

        vegaEmbed('#chart20', myChart20);
      </script>
 </div>
    
  <p> The regression equation was calculated using a regplot Seaborn function in Colab and then was plugged into Vega Lite to generate the regression plot. Find the relevant Colab notebook 
<a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/project/GEIxSMI.ipynb">here</a>. R squared (R^2) is calculated in Vega Lite. R^2 is the square of the correlation 
between the independent and dependent variables, it measures the proportion of variation in the dependent variable that can be attributed to the independent variable and takes values from 0 to 1. R^2 of 0.72 
means that 72% of variation in the Social Mobility Index is explained by Global Entrepreneurship Index, which suggests a strong correlation between the two indicators. </p>
