<hr>

    <p> Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals either up or down the socioeconomic ladder relative to the position of their parents. Global Social Mobility Index (SMI) measures the impact 
of socio-economic background on one’s outcomes in life. It is determined based on the following indicators: health, education, technology access, work opportunities, working conditions and social protection. 
This project seeks to understand the relationship between business climate and social mobility. This is done by evaluating entrepreneurship indicators around the world and plotting SMI and related measures against them. </p>
    
<!-- Chart 17 -- Social Mobility Index around the world -->
 <div class="chart" id="chart17">
      <script>
        var myChart17 = "ProjectSocMobIndex.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart17', myChart17);
      </script>
 </div>
    <p> As evident from Figure 1, on average, SMI is higher in Europe and lower in African and Caribbean states. SMI varies the most in Asia, with countries like Bangladesh having SMI as low as 40, and states like 
Japan scoring over 70. </p>   
    
    
    <p> Find the Colab notebook for Figure 1 <a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/socMob_Pov.ipynb">here</a>. SMI is scraped from the Business Insider website (
<a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/social_mob_ind_scraping.ipynb">here</a> is the Colab notebook), and poverty data is scraped from Wikipedia (<a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/poverty1.ipynb">here</a>
 is the Colab notebook). To be joined together, data frames must have a common column name, so I rename one column and join the data frames. Poverty values are in percentage and are not recognised as numeric in Vega-Lite. 
I remove the “%” sign, change the data type to numeric and create a new data frame. Then I join it with the original data frame, as they have one column in common. </p>
      
    
    <!-- Chart 22 -- Cost to open a business over time (as % of income per capita) -->
 <div class="chart" id="chart22">
      <script>
        var myChart22 = "CostOverTime.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart22', myChart22);
      </script>
 </div>   
   
    <p> The data for Figure 2 is downloaded using the World Bank library in Python. The Colab notebook is availible <a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/CostOverTime.ipynb">here</a>. 
As evident from Figure 2, cost of opening a business in states with the lowest SMI (Guatemala, Senegal, Cameroon) has been declining significantly over the last two decades. Meanwhile, for countries with the highest SMI (Canada, UK, Denmark), 
it fluctuated but stayed below 4% of income per capita. Clearly, there is a negative relationship between SMI and cost of opening a business. </p> 
    
<!-- Chart 18 -- Days and cost to start a business -->
 <div class="chart" id="chart18">
      <script>
        var myChart18 = "DaysCostBar.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart18', myChart18);
      </script>
 </div>
   
    <p> Judging from Figure 3, there is some positive relationship between cost of starting a business and days it takes. Most Western, some Asian and South American states follow this pattern. However, there are many outliers, 
such as South Africa, where it takes almost the longest to start a business, but it costs the least. </p>
    
    
    <p> The data for Figure 3 is accessed via the World Bank API using For loops in Python to iterate through the country list and obtain name and value for each country. 
See the Colab notebooks for <a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/cost_to_start_business.ipynb">cost</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/days_to_start_business.ipynb">days</a> to open a business, and combining the 
<a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/cost%2Bdays.ipynb">two</a> in one dataset. </p>
      
    
 <!-- Chart 19 -- Poverty level and cost of opening a business (% of income)  -->
 <div class="chart" id="chart19">
      <script>
        var myChart19 = "PovertyCost.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart19', myChart19);
      </script>
 </div>

 <p> Poverty level is negatively correlated with SMI, which is evident from <a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/Reg_SMIxPOV.ipynb">this</a> regression analysis. 
A positive relationship between cost of starting a business and proportion of population in poverty is clear from Figure 4. </p>


   
   <p> Cost is acquired via the World Bank API using for loops in Python. The cost data frame is then merged with an existing social mobility and poverty data frame. 
<a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/mob_cost_pov.ipynb">Here</a> is the Colab notebook.</p>

   
<!-- Chart 20 --Regressing Social Mobility Index on Global Entrepreneurship Index -->
 <div class="chart" id="chart20">
      <script>
        var myChart20 = "RegressionProject.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart20', myChart20);
      </script>
 </div>
    
  <p> Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI) is calculated by the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute and is scraped from their website. The regression equation for Figure 5 was calculated using the regplot Seaborn function in Colab and then was plugged into Vega-Lite 
to generate a regression plot. <a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/GEIxSMI.ipynb">Here</a> is the Colab notebook. R squared (R2) is calculated in Vega-Lite. R2 is the square of the correlation between the independent and dependent variables, 
it measures the proportion of variation in the dependent variable that can be attributed to the independent variable. R2 of 0.72 means that 72% of the variation in SMI is explained by GEI, which suggests a strong positive correlation between the two indicators. </p>
     
   
<!-- Chart 21 -- Social Mobility Index and number of new business registrations per 1000 people -->
 <div class="chart" id="chart21">
      <script>
        var myChart21 = "BusRegSocMob.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart21', myChart21);
      </script>
 </div>
 
<p> New business registrations data was downloaded from the World Bank website and edited in Colab. It is then merged with the data on social mobility and poverty. <a href="https://github.com/marinabrts/marinabrts.github.io/blob/main/bus_mob_pov.ipynb">Here<a/> is the Colab notebook. 
There is a positive correlation between new business registrations and SMI. As anticipated, Cyprus, Luxemburg and Malta, countries with low tax rates, have more business registrations for their SMI relative to other states in the sample. </p>
   
    
    <p class=sub><b><span style="color:rgb(255, 237, 61)">Conclusion: </span></b><p>
    
<p> Several entrepreneurship indicators have been plotted against SMI and poverty level. The research has identified a negative relationship between the cost of starting a business and SMI, a positive correlation between the cost of 
starting a business and poverty, a positive correlation between the Global Entrepreneurship Index and SMI and a positive correlation between business registrations and SMI. Therefore, there is a clear positive correlation between social mobility 
and a favorable business climate.</p>
 
<p> This project does not intend to establish causal connections between the indicators, which may be investigated in further research. Furthermore, the relationship between social mobility and entrepreneurship may be subject to omitted variable bias from not accounting for variables like GDP per capita or political stability. 
This should be considered in research aiming to estimate causal relationship between the two. </p>
